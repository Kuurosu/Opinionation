# Opinionation

Opinionation is a website that allows users to read and share their opinions on various movies and TV shows. The website is designed to be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with several key elements that make it stand out.

### Navbar

The navbar is located at the top of the website and contains links to different sections of the website. It includes the Opinionation logo on the left side which doubles as the "Home" button, followed by links to "Log in" or "Register". On the right hand side is a short slogan to emphasize the reason for the website.

When the user has logged in using the "Log In" link, the "Log In" and "Register" links disappear, and are instead replaced with a single "Log Out" link.

If the user is an Admin after logging in, they are presented with the same log out link, but instead on the right there is an extra "Create Post" button which I will go in more depth further down. 

Also next to the slogan when the user has logged in, there is a small "Welcome *name*" shown to the currently logged in user to display their username within the message.

### Hero Image

The hero image is a large banner that spans the width of the website, located below the navbar. It features an simple image of a cinema audience with a short headline that is another simple slogan for the website.

### Posts

The website's main content consists of posts written by the admin on movies or TV shows. Each post has a title, the author's name, the date of publication, a short summary, a like/dislike button, a like/dislike ratio, and the number of comments within the post. Clicking on a post takes users to the full article where they can read the entire post, leave comments and like/dislike the post.

### Footer

The footer is located at the bottom of the website and contains links to the website's social media pages, including Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. It also includes a simple "Made by Rob Sizeland".
